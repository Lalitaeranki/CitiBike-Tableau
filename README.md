# CitiBike-Tableau
## Objective
 In this assignment the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History   Logs for the year 2016  is cleaned using pandas and visualized using Tableau to build a data dashboard  and  answer the following questions:
 
 
1.How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

2.By what percentage has total ridership grown?

3.How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

4.What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?

5.What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

6.Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

7.Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

8.Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

9.Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

10.Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

11.How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

12.How does the average trip duration change by age?

13.What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

14.How variable is the utilization by bike ID?
